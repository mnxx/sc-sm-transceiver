## MAIN PAPERS

### Single-Carrier SM-MIMO: A Promising Design for Broadband Large-Scale Antenna Systems
    - main limitations of employing LSA for f-s channels: complexity, power consumption, high cost RF chains
    - LS-MIMO: tens to hundreds of tas/ras -> RF chains + complex signal generation & detection
    - SM design paradigm: low-complexity & energy-efficient
    - problems w/ OFDM: jeopardizes single RF-benefits of SM-MIMO, PAPR, computational burden (DFT for each ta)
    - f-s channel may be converted into a flat fading channel by using carefully designed receive filters
    - SC-SM architecture has potential of expolitung joint advantages of both SM and SC techniques
      - m_SM = ld(N_T * M_SM) bits sent over one SM symbol
      - each block: prefix part, data part (data part has K symbols consisting of m_SM bits)
      - each transmit block can be generated by three steps (sm mapping algorithm)
      - four types of gurad interval schemes: SP, ZP, KSP, non-prefix
      - cp: elimination of IBI, transofrms linear convolution into a circular one (low-complexity channel diagonalizaiton in f-domain)
      - cp: power efficiency reduciton of K/(K + ZP_len)
      - zp: supports linear receiver in achieving full multipath diversity in some tx scenarios
      - zp: increased receiver complexity
      - ksp: known symbol padding, symbols can be directly used as pilot symbols
      - ksp: power efficiency loss
      - non: no overhead, IBI can be reduced using powerful receivers, implicit teaining can be adopted
      - diversity order achieved w/ CP scheme under ML only determined by number of RA
      - capable of outperforming its ODM-based counterpart
      - however, high detection complexity and mutipath diversity gain erosio
      - ZP-based scheme reduces the order of ML detection comlexity from (N_t * M_SM)^K to (N_t * M_SM)^L
      - also offers a full receive and mutlipath diversity order of L * N_r, significant performance improvement
      - example for SC-SM transmission
      - ber performance over Rayleigh fading channels tested, considering different detectors
      - ZP-aided SC-SM scheme using ML capable of achieving considerable diversity gain, best BER performance
      - performs better tahn CP-counterpart, since data detection errors may affect both information symbols and CP symbols
      - CP-aided systems w/ MMSE or MMSE-FDE exhibit lower complexity orders, since one-tap eq is possible
      - however, they suffer from multipath diversity gain loss
      - complexity of ZP-aided SC-SM may be further reduces by explitting the spatial-domain sparsity of SM symbols [88]
      - SC-SM schemes require only a single RF chain at the transmitter
      - further investigation required to strike an attractive tradeoff:
      - amongst detection complexity, attainable BER, tx efficiency, power efficiency
      - SC-SM is special case of SC-GSM w/ N_g = 1, strikes trade-off among transmit rate, RF cost as well as detection complexity
      - STdM exploits resolvable multipath components of f-s channel as novel means of conveying additional source information
      - STdM found to be more energy-efficient than SC-SM
      - STdM design critically hinges on idealized assumption that independent symbol-spaced taps are available for MIMO channels
      - SFSK exploits specific indices of pre-designed space-time dispersion matrices for conveying extra implicit information
      - SFSK requires multiple RF chains and advantages of single-RF are eroded
      - traditional receivers not directly suitable:
      - conventional SM detectors focused on flat-fading scenarios, i.e. no ISI
      - existing MIMO detectors assume N_r > N_t (channel matrix has column full-rank)
      - FDE: low-complexity approach to ISI mitigation, in scenarios exhibiting long CIR
      - SC-FDE used in 3GPP LTE
      - most mentioned FDE algorithms only suitable for N_r > N_t scenarios
      - TDE: transmit vectors of SM schemes are sparsely populated, since only single ta activated
      - order of ML detection complexity in ZP-aided SC-SM scheme only depends on CIR length rather than frame length
      - proposed LSS detector also capable of efficient operation in challenging rank-deficient channel scenarios
      - TEQ: classic scheme is effective soft-decision receiver in f-s fading channels, incorporating eq and channel decoding
      - ...
      
      
      
### A Low-Complexity Detection Scheme for Generalized Spatial Modulation Aided Single Carrier Systems
    - GSM combines SM and V-BLAST
    - compared to PIC-R-SIC, scheme offers near ML detection performance while avoiding complicated matrix operations
    - performance improvement in particular in rank-deficient channel scenarios
    - GSM higher spectral efficiency compared to conventional SM
    - BER performance of GSM dominated by the detectors
    - ZP-aided SM-SC scheme is prefered over CP-aided SM-SC and SM-OFDM schemes in terms of BER
    - PIC-R-SIC: projection matrix, orthogonal to sub-channel matrix
      - GSM sytem: N_u out of N_t tas activated each time slot
      - PIC-R-SIC: if (K+P-1)N_r =< (K-1)N_t, G_I_k may become rank deficient causing an inaccurate detection
      - conventional search algorithms, sphere decoding and M-algorithm aided QR-decomposition, not effectively applicable
      - possible rank-deficiency limits application of M-algorithm aided QR-decomposition
      - sphere decoding achieves near-ML performance, but introduces high complexity
      - proposed scheme: QR-decomposition avoided - single stream ML detection employed
      - first step: all possible candidate vectors are generated, based on square Euclidean distances
      - sort in ascended order and M smallest metrics out of Q are selected
      - M legitimate GSM vectors D_1 corresponding to the selected metrics e_1 are obtained
      - second step: second term of receiver signal is detected
      - M^ combinations of x_1 and x_2 corresponding to smallest metrics e_2 are obtained
      - repeat until Kth step
      - complexity of scheme increases with M
      - still achieves complexity reduction of 56% to SD and 78% to PIC-R-SIC and 98% to ML at K=4
      - performance increases with M
      - trade-off between performance and complexity
    - scheme offers better BER performance than PIC-R-SIC with reduced complexity
    - with increasing M, scheme approaches ML detector


### Effects of Channel Estimation on Spatial Modulation
    - simultaneous pilot transmissions from the AEs are impossible in SM scheme
    - performance penaly (BER), while relying on realistiv imperfect channel-estimation
    - SM especially beneficial for a high number of AEs, thus effects of pilot overhead and channel estimation errors
    - proposed schemes have the potential of combating above-mentiones CSU-error related limitations
      - training symbols P w/ power constraint tr[PP^H] = t (t is pilot length)
      - in the single-RF SM transmitter the pilot matrix P is sparse, each column has only a single non-zero element
      - 3 dB performance penalty over the perfect CSI scenario in simplified edge case
      - no feedback from receiver needed
      - Reduced-Complexity Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection:
      - reduces effects of CE error without increasing pilot overhead
      - 1) initial channel estimation w/ MMSE criterion, iteration index = 0
      - 2) frame of SM symbols are detected w/ reduced-complexity ML, attain estimated symbol block
      - 3) update channel estimates based on MMSE criterion
      - 4) iteration or termination, if breaking condition - terminate iteration, otherwise i = i+1 & goto 2)
      - termination constant beta has to be sufficiently low
      - Non-Coherently Detected Single-RF STSK Scheme
      - [...]
      - proposed scheme closely approaches perfect-CSI curve, while conventional CE exhibits 3-dB degradation
    - increasing number of tas increases transmission power of pilot symbols, bandwidth efficiency is reduced
    - low SNR as well as correlated channels - single-RF based pilot transmission suffers from performance loss


## BACKGROUND PAPERS

### Spatial Modulation Aided Zero-Padded Single Carrier Transmission for Dispersive Channels
    - zero-padded SC-SM offers full multipath diversity under ML detection, unlike CP systems
    - order of complexity is independent of frame length and only depends on number of multipath links
    - advantages: full multipath diversity and relatively low ML detection complexity
    - substantial contributor to high decoding complexity is IAI
    - e.g. V-BLAST ML decoding complexity is exponential w/ N_t
    - SM completely avoids IAI, only one ta active, LSS ML detector at the receiver
    - SM scheme in CP-SC cannot exploit multipath diversity (ML decoding at rx), hence diversity order N_r
    - ML decoding complexity (N_t * M)^K
    - ZP-aided scheme offers full diversity, requiring one RF chain, order (N_t * M)^P 
    - PIC-R allows system to be converted into set of block fading subsystems, same as flat fading scenario
      - ...
      
### Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying in Single Carrier Communication
    - diversity order of CP-SC under ML detection is N_r


### An Improved QRD-M Algorithm in MIMO Communications
    - >> understand M algorithm
      - in the sense of minimizing error probability, MLSD is the optimal
      - exhaustive search through whole alphabet is infeasible/costly
      - perform QR decomposition of channel matrix B
      - Q is 2N_r x 2N_r, and R is 2N_r x 2N_t
      - in R we have T, a 2N_t x 2N_t up-triangle matrix
      - r = Bs + n becomes r~ = Ts + n~, with r~ = Q* r and n~ = Q* n
      - since T is an up-triangle matrix, it can be resolved by tree traversal methods in graph theory
      - QRD-M is a breadth-first tree traversal algorithm, reducing system complexity by keeping only M candidates
      - candidates have best accumulated metrics at each tree searching stage
      

### M-Algorithm-Based Optimal Detectors for Spatial Modulation (Online / Journal of Communications)
    - M-algorithm reduces complexity of ML detection by combining with the QR decompostition and tree search structure
    - modified M-ML detector proposed with optimal BER performance
    - SM more suitable as an uplink transmission
    - M-algorithm based constellation-reduction algorithm/detector, MCR, proposed
      - since only one ta active, no need for QR decomposition to realize layer search
      - variable complexity depending on the controllable value of M
      - MCR retains M_0 candidate constellation points with smallest metrics to form a new set G
      - then joint detection can be done to achieve optimal performance
      - reduces the complexity when system has at least 2 tas
      - reduction complexity for MCR with ML mainly depends on M_0
      - fixed complexity thanks to M-algorithm, better suited for practical implementation
      - spere decoder (SM-SD) has variable complexity and serial detection structure
      - drawbacks: higher average complexity, complicated metric sorting process
      - complexity of ML detection with high-order modulation increases more significantly than M-ML
      - channel correlation has great negative influence on BER performance, tas difficult to distinguish
